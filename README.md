Etsy Thug (assistant / UI concept)
====================================
UI tool for making collections on Etsy.

* _IMPORTANT: It works, BUT - right now it's still in kinda Proof-of-Concept state. So the code quality is whack._
* _IMPORTANT: Currently tested only on Chrome._
* _IMPORTANT: Not responsive yet._

Making collections in [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com) is still a very mundane task. In order to make life easier, you just pack this stuff on any LAMP-Server (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP, most providers rent these) - and run it like a thug. Looks like this:

### Install:
* Download this shit from GitHub and unzip to any LAMP-server. If you consider yourself a nab or don't get it - ask your local computer geeks how you setup a LAMP-server or just an Apache server on your localhost.

### Use:
* Go through the images of the items on the left side of the screen. If you like any, click on 'ADD' button under the image - and it will appear on the right side of the screen,
* Right half is 4x4, just like the collections on Etsy. Move the cool items you've added in step 1 around (drag & drop) until it makes sence to you,
* On the bottom of the right half you will always see the updated list of links for the collection you've just built. These are needed when you create your awesome collection on Etsy. That's all, dawg...
